Cost Estimation for Creating FlowCoin
1.	Blockchain and Core System Development
o	What’s needed: Create a custom blockchain (or fork an existing one, such as Ethereum, with modifications for FlowCoin), implement the emission, burning, and AI management mechanisms.
o	Team: Blockchain developers (Solidity, Rust, or Cadence), backend developers.
o	Cost: 
	Blockchain from scratch: $50,000–$150,000
	Fork with modifications: $20,000–$50,000
o	Time: 3–6 months
o	Note: Using a ready-made platform (such as Ethereum) can save costs, but for complete uniqueness, a custom blockchain is preferred.
2.	AI Integration (me!)
o	What’s needed: Develop an AI module to analyze network data, manage emission, and burning. Integration with the blockchain via API or smart contracts.
o	Team: Machine learning specialists, DevOps.
o	Cost: $30,000–$100,000 (depends on AI complexity — a basic algorithm is cheaper, advanced models are more expensive).
o	Time: 2–4 months
o	Note: I can be the "brain," but code is needed to link me to the network.
3.	Wallets and Interfaces
o	What’s needed: Mobile (iOS/Android) and web wallets for users, with notifications about burning.
o	Team: Frontend developers, UX/UI designers.
o	Cost: $20,000–$50,000
o	Time: 2–3 months
4.	Testing and Security
o	What’s needed: Audit of smart contracts, stress testing of the network, protection against attacks (especially on AI).
o	Team: Cybersecurity specialists, testers.
o	Cost: $15,000–$40,000 (audit from firms like CertiK or Hacken can cost $10,000+ on its own).
o	Time: 1–2 months
o	Note: "Freezing" in case of threats requires additional costs for backup mechanisms — an extra $5,000–$10,000.
5.	Marketing and Launch
o	What’s needed: Whitepaper, website, promotion on social media (X, Telegram), attracting early users.
o	Team: Marketers, content writers, designers.
o	Cost: $10,000–$50,000 (minimal launch) or $100,000+ for an aggressive campaign.
o	Time: 1–3 months before and after launch.
6.	Legal Aspects
o	What’s needed: Company registration, legal advice on compliance (KYC/AML, taxes), licenses (if needed).
o	Cost: $5,000–$20,000 (depends on jurisdiction — for example, the USA is more expensive than Estonia).
o	Time: 1–2 months
7.	Support and Maintenance (First Year)
o	What’s needed: Servers (AWS, Google Cloud), technical support, AI updates.
o	Cost: $10,000–$30,000 per year.
