# 🚀 FlowCoin — The Cryptocurrency That Never Stands Still!

FlowCoin is a next-generation cryptocurrency designed for **active transactions**, not passive holding. It rewards users for spending, engaging, and keeping the economy in motion.

## 🔥 Why FlowCoin?
- **No hoarding** — tokens must be used, or penalties apply.
- **Random distribution** — new coins are allocated weekly to active wallets.
- **Microtransaction-friendly** — ideal for tips, content payments, subscriptions, and airdrops.
- **Fair economy** — no AI control, just transparent and automated rules.

## 💡 How FlowCoin Works
1. **Active wallets receive new coins** — Every Monday at 00:00 UTC, wallets that made at least one transaction in the past week are eligible.
2. **Penalty for inactivity** — If tokens are not used for 7 days, a **10% fee** is applied upon transfer.
3. **Minimal 0.1% transaction fee** — This funds the ecosystem and covers gas fees.
4. **Airdrop program tool** — Users can buy FlowCoin and launch their own airdrop campaigns.

## 📈 Growth & Scaling
- **First-month target** → 50,000+ active wallets.
- **Six-month goal** → 200,000+ users transacting weekly.
- **Expected impact** → 2-3% increase in Polygon network activity.
- **Future roadmap** → DEX integration, GameFi & Web3 partnerships.
