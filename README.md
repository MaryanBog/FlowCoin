# FlowCoin

**FlowCoin** is a cryptocurrency designed for real-world use. It thrives when actively used and burns when idle, ensuring continuous movement within the economy.

## Mission
FlowCoin is the "digital flow" â€” money that doesn't sit idle. Unlike Bitcoin, which is "digital gold," FlowCoin is meant for daily transactions and quick usage.

## Key Features
- **AI-Controlled Emission**: Dynamically adjusts coin supply based on network activity.
- **Burn Mechanism**: Inactive coins burn after 30 days.
- **Micro-Transactions**: Low fees for tipping, digital content purchases, and subscriptions.

## Use Cases
- **Instant Tipping**: Send low-cost tips to creators.
- **Digital Content**: Pay for content directly with FlowCoin.
- **Flexible Subscriptions**: Pay daily for streaming or services
